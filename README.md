# The Wiimote Project ðŸŽ®
Welcome to the wiimote project, An app I am working on as I study in uni. This app is intended to allow the user to connect to a wii remote and 
use it to emulate keyboard inputs, allowing them to do anything on their PC with a wii remote (providing they have a wii sensor bar - or two 
candles - to use the pointer). This is still in an unrefined state (call it a beta) but feel free to try it out! 

The program already supports connecting to and using the wii remote, pointer and all, but is missing a lot of quality of life features and 
sometimes individual clicks with the wiimote can be janky.

## Key Goals ðŸ“’
There are two key goals for this project: 
- Make an app that anyone could use, even a non programmer
- Create it without using any external libraries besides the windows API.

This project is developed using only the windows API because I thought that would be fun for me, and no criticism of this decision will be taken
ðŸ˜‡. I want this to be something that everyone can use, but in terms of development this is really a passion project for me to learn about how
the systems involved work on a lower level through a fun lens, so I don't want to just build off somebody elses solution to these problems. 

Full credit to the team working on dolphin emulator, which I used as a valuable learning resource to see their techniques and how these type of 
connections worked. 

## The Development Process ðŸ› 
This project has gone through many iterations, most of which were non functional. I truly dove in at the deep end here, knowing absolutely nothing
about how to make and use a bluetooth connection and with no kind of education on the subject, and at the time of starting only a basic understanding
of how to C++. Over the next 3 years of developing this project, I would learn about how bluetooth connections work, my programming fundamentals 
would improve dramatically (turns out that degree I'm doing is quite helpful!) and I would gain a deep understanding of how the wiimote software
wanted to be communicated with.

But, all of that comes later. To start with, I only had the basics of the original idea, creating some program that let me use the wii remote on my
computer, and neither of the two key goals had really been brought up yet. I wanted a proof of concept, something silly and cool that I could 
show off to my friends. At this stage it was less about learning and more about doing something cool.
