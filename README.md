# The Wiimote Project

Welcome to the wiimote project, an app I am working on as I study in uni. This project is intended to be an app which allows the user to connect to a wii remote and use it to emulate keyboard inputs, allowing them to do anything on their PC with a wii remote (providing they have a wii sensor bar - or two candles - for the pointer).

## Key Goals
There are two key goals for this project: Make an app that anyone could use, even a non programmer, and create it without using any external libraries. this project is developed using only the windows API to achieve it's goal of being accessible and useable to anyone who wishes to try it.
