# The Wiimote Project ðŸŽ®

Welcome to the wiimote project, An app I am working on as I study in uni. This app is intended to allow the user to connect to a wii remote and use it to emulate keyboard inputs, allowing them to do anything on their PC with a wii remote (providing they have a wii sensor bar - or two candles - to use the pointer). This is still in an unrefined state (call it a beta) but feel free to try it out! 

The program already supports connecting to and using the wii remote, pointer and all, but is missing a lot of quality of life features and sometimes individual clicks with the wiimote can be janky.

## Key Goals ðŸ“’

There are two key goals for this project: 
- Make an app that anyone could use, even a non programmer
- Create it without using any external libraries besides the windows API.

This project is developed using only the windows API because I thought that would be fun for me, and no criticism of this decision will be taken ðŸ˜‡. I want this to be something that everyone can use, but in terms of development this is really a passion project for me to learn about how the systems involved work on a lower level through a fun lens, so I don't want to just build off somebody elses solution to these problems. 

Full credit to the team working on dolphin emulator, which I used as a valuable learning resource to see their techniques and how these type of connections worked.
